# pickup-rating

### Requirements

* Node.js 6.0

Maybe it can run in older versions, but I don't know.

git clone https://github.com/em92/pickup-rating.git
cd ./pickup-rating
npm update
```

That's it. Now run
```
node main.js
```

### ToDo

* ratings table/collection for #qlpickup.ru and "Attack & Defend"
* handler for Predath0r's feeder (/stats/submit)
* Predath0r's feeder installation instructions
